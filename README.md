# 👋 Hi there, I'm Deep Rudra!

🎓 I'm a passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering student from Kalyani Government Engineering College.
I am an engineering student who loves technology and new ideas. I have practical experience in areas like embedded systems, robotics, chip design, and machine learning. I enjoy working on challenging projects where I can use my skills to solve real problems. I am always eager to learn new things and keep up with the latest technologies. I want to be a valuable part of a company by bringing energy, creativity, and teamwork to every project

🔧 I love building intelligent hardware and software systems that can solve real-world problems. From autonomous drones navigating Mars-like terrains to AI-powered security systems, I’m constantly working on exciting, hands-on innovations.
